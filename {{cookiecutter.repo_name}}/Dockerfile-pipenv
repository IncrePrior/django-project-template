# Dockerfile for Pipenv wrapper
# Unfortunately it seems not possible to reuse the Django Dockerfile, as not installing any packages in it
# will result in all .build-deps apks being deleted from it and pipenv failing to lock/install
# The build steps of this file are taken from the Django Dockerfile to make the build a bit faster though.
