# Thorgate's Django project template

[Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) project template that we use at [Thorgate](http://thorgate.eu).

Brings some useful out-of-the-box functionality, sane configuration, deploy helpers and more.


## Usage

To use this template, first ensure that you have
[Cookiecutter](http://cookiecutter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/readme.html) available. 
If not, you can install it from pip: `pip install cookiecutter`.

Then just execute:
    
    cookiecutter dir/to/django-project-template/

It will ask you a few questions, e.g. project's name.

After generation completes, search for any TODOs in the code and make appropriate changes where needed.
