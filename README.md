## Usage

To use this template, first ensure that you have
[Cookiecutter](http://cookiecutter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/readme.html) available.
You should probably create additional python3 virtual environment for cookiecutter, activate it
and then install following packages by running following commands:
`pip install cookiecutter`
`pip install cookiecutter_repo_extensions`
`pip install fqdn`


Then just execute:

    cookiecutter dir/to/django-project-template/

It will ask you a few questions, e.g. project's name.

After generation completes, search for any TODOs in the code and make appropriate changes where needed.

See README.md in the generated project for instructions on how to set up your development environment.


## Upgrading project template

First ensure you have a python3 interpreter with `cookiecutter` installed.

To upgrade an existing project, change the current working directory to the root of the project you want to upgrade. i.e. `cd project-to-upgrade`. Ensure your are not in the `template` branch.

Then run `python ~/path/to/django-project-template/upgrade-template.py`

This will make a commit to the branch `template` in your project with the updates to the project template. Then merge the `template` branch.
