# Released version of pytest-cookies (0.4.0) has the following in dependencies array inside its setup.py:
#
#    - pytest<5.0.0,>=3.3.0
#    - cookiecutter>=1.4.0,<=1.6.0
#
# However it seems to be perfectly compatible with those versions (confirmed by its own CI and our template
#  tests). This is why we are currently installing it from Git. Change back to upstream version once
#  the [PR](https://github.com/hackebrot/pytest-cookies/pull/45) is merged and released.
